**HOW TO USE:**
ONLY RUN thing.py


**basically what this does is:**
it dumps all of the words that meet the 100 pt words criteria in the words_alpha_fr.txt file into the good_words.txt file when you run it. 

words_alpha_fr.txt has a lot of common english words (400k+)


**100 PT WORD CRITERIA:**
a is 1 pt,
b is 2 pts
...
z is 26 pts

sum of pts for each letter in a words must be 100
